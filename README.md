# P1-adapter

This is an adapter for the Mozilla WebThings Gateway that allows it to connect to smart meters that follow the P1 standard.

You will need a special USB cable that plugs into your Raspberry Pi at one end, and into your smart meter at the other.

If the addon doesn't automatically connect, then you'll have to select which USB port you want to use in the addon's settings.
